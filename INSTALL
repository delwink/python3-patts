Installing python3-patts
========================

Before installing python3-patts, one must satisfy its runtime and setup
dependencies.

| Library            | Purpose                                               |
|--------------------+-------------------------------------------------------|
| CPython 3          | Python programming language interpreter.              |
| python3-setuptools | Python 3 package distribution and installation tools. |
| libpatts           | C backend functionality.                              |

Installing the Dependencies
---------------------------

On GNU/Linux, one usually installs required libraries using a package
manager. These differ between distributions; we have below the example for
Debian GNU/Linux and derivatives (such as Trisquel).

    # apt-get install python3 python3-setuptools

You will likely need to build libpatts manually, unless your software
distribution packages it for you. The following should work on any GNU system.

    $ wget http://delwink.com/dl/libpatts-delX.Y.Z.tar.gz
    $ tar xzf libpatts-delX.Y.Z.tar.gz
    $ cd libpatts-delX.Y.Z
    $ ./autogen.sh
    $ ./configure
    $ make
    # make install

Take a look at libpatts' INSTALL file for more details on building it and
properly installing it for your operating system.

Building python3-patts
----------------------

Python is an interpreted language which will automatically build when executed,
but it is possible to build this module ahead of time using the setuptools
features. You can build source distributions with

    $ python3 setup.py sdist

and you can build executable distributions with

    $ python3 setup.py bdist

Installing python3-patts
------------------------

If you have created an executable distribution as shown above, you can install
it on any system by extracting it in the root directory (on Unix-like
systems). Otherwise, you can install it on the current system using

    # python3 setup.py install
